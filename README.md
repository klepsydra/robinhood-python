# robinhood-python &#128480;
Robinhood module with convenience scripts for automating common activites (downloading entire history, trading, etc.)

Some current caveats:
* Development has been in python 3, I'm not taking much care to keep python 2 support at the moment.
* The scripts currently default to extreme caching policies, use --live to guarantee most recent data.
* Much of the code will assert (or not) in scenarioes where states and paging is involved where they haven't been handled correctly yet

## Security

* Certificate pinning is used to block against MITM attacks

## Module

* [RobinhoodClient](robinhood/RobinhoodClient.py)
  * Client that handles getting data from the Robinhood APIs
* [RobinhoodCachedClient](robinhood/RobinhoodCachedClient.py)
  * Client that handles caching on top of the normal client
* [RobinhoodPortfolio](robinhood/RobinhoodPortfolio.py)
  * Utility to help process an entire portfolio in a consistent manner

## Scripts

### Account

* [login.py](login.py)
  * Forces a new login and caches the token. Note most scripts will do this
    automatically so you usually don't need to call this.
* [logout.py](logout.py)
  * Invalidates the current auth token and deletes the cached token
* [enable_mfa.py](enable_mfa.py) [app|sms]
  * Enables MFA for login
* [disable_mfa.py](disable_mfa.py)
  * Disables MFA for login
